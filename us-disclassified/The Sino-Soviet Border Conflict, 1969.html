<blockquote>During the spring and summer of 1969, U.S. government officials

watched the ideological and political split between the Soviet Union and

the People's Republic of China escalate into fighting on Sino-Soviet borders.

Some U.S. officials wondered whether the clashes would escalate; some even

speculated that the Soviet Union might launch attacks on Chinese nuclear

weapons facilities. This electronic briefing book of declassified U.S.

government documents captures the apprehensions on the U.S. side as well

as on the part of the Chinese and the Russians, with Moscow worried about

China's nuclear potential and Beijing worried about a Soviet attack. The

briefing book includes some of the most significant sources cited in an

article in the current issue of <a href="http://www.frankcass.com/jnls/cwh.htm"><i>Cold

War History</i>, "Sino-American Relations, 1969: Sino-Soviet Border Conflict

and Steps Toward Rapprochement,"</a> by William Burr, a senior analyst

at the National Security Archive. Drawing on archival records and material

released through the <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu./project/foia">Freedom

of Information Act</a>, the article reviews the Nixon administration's

early steps toward a new relationship with the People's Republic of China

and the impact of Sino-Soviet tensions on the moves toward rapprochement

taken by both Beijing and Washington.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The documents presented here highlight

Washington's perceptions of the border tensions that escalated during March

1969 and the internal U.S. government discussions of the possibility of

a wider Sino-Soviet war. The material also elucidates the Soviet Union's

use of covert military threats to coerce Beijing into entering diplomatic

negotiations over the disputed borders. A State Department memorandum of

conversation, published here for the first time,&nbsp; recounts one of

the more extraordinary moments in Cold War history--a KGB officer's query

about the U.S. reaction to a hypothetical Soviet attack on Chinese nuclear

weapons facilities. Also included is a recently declassified report warning

of the danger of a Soviet attack on China, written for Henry Kissinger

by the influential China watcher Allen S. Whiting.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archival documents also illustrate secret White

House initiatives during the summer and fall of 1969 to turn a page in

Sino-American relations.&nbsp; Convinced that Sino-Soviet tensions provided

a basis for rapprochement but also determined to minimize the State Department's

role, Nixon and Kissinger tried to open secret communications with China

through Pakistan and Romania. Other documents show how State Department

officials tried to assert a role in policymaking on rapprochement and,

before they were cut out altogether, made important contributions to White

House efforts to signal a friendly interest in communications with China.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This briefing book also includes some interesting

CIA Directorate of Intelligence material released through the Archive's

FOIA requests.&nbsp; Top-secret "Weekly Reviews", published every Friday

at noon, helped keep officials "with a need to know" apprised of current

events, such as the Sino-Soviet border clashes. A reference in a report

on Chinese diplomacy (<a href="#doc28">document 28</a>) to a secret directive

from Zhou En-lai suggest that U.S. intelligence, perhaps the Hong Kong

"China watchers", could acquire significant information on Chinese policymaking

from refugees and other contacts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This CIA report highlights some of the problems that complicated

Moscow's efforts to encourage negotiations with Beijing over disputed borders.

Although the Soviets wanted to enter into border negotiations with the

PRC, they refused to accede to Beijing's demands that Moscow acknowledge

that the nineteenth century border agreements were "unequal treaties" akin

to those forced on China by Western imperialism. Until the Soviets changed

their policy (or the Chinese dropped this demand), Beijing would only agree

to participate in comparatively low-level river navigation talks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Partly based on information from sources in Hong Kong as well

as a NCNA [New China News Agency] article, this report analyzed the anti-Soviet

campaign then mobilizing in China. INR's China watchers suspected that

Chinese authorities promoted the campaign to "coalesce internal unity"

and strengthen the regime, but they also believed that it reflected a "genuine

fear of [Soviet] attack." To that extent, Beijing designed the domestic

mobilization--the manifestation of "national consciousness of the Soviet

danger"--to have a deterrent effect on the Kremlin's decisionmaking. Significantly,

the NCNA piece suggested some concern about Soviet nuclear-armed missiles

on the border while INR cited a nuclear threat made during an unofficial

Soviet radio broadcast during March 1969.</blockquote>

Yuri Linkov and John H. Holdridge, Director of Office of Research and Analysis

for East Asia and Pacific at INR, although he was about to join Kissinger's

White House staff. More incidents of border fighting had broken out and

the discussion gave Holdridge an opportunity to express concern that the

conflict could escalate, especially if "some junior lieutenant [made] a

wrong decision." Tacitly warning the Soviets to avoid escalatory measures,

Holdridge referred to the unforeseen dangers of full-scale war: it could

"extend into other areas of the world and indeed threaten a large proportion

of the world's population."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Possibly written by John Holdridge, this report helps explain

why he worried about the risks of escalation. Treating Beijing as the "provocateur"

in the border conflict, INR analysts argued that Chinese "tactics make

sense as an attempt to deter a Soviet attack, using traditional Chinese

methods." The problem was that if the Soviets remained obdurate and the

Chinese met obduracy with more provocations, there was an "increased chance

of escalation into wider conflict."</blockquote>

<blockquote>This document reports on a discussion of the border clashes

by the State Department's China and Soviet specialists headed by Assistant

Secretary for Far Eastern and Pacific Affairs Marshall Green. The participants

agreed that the border conflict was "serious" and that "suspicion of US

collusion with the other" increased "nervousness" on both sides. Although

the analysts believed that neither side wanted the conflict to escalate,

they recognized that there "seems to be no common ground for agreement."

The Soviet watchers considered the possibility that Moscow might launch

a "surgical strike against Chinese nuclear installations" but suggested

that it was a less than likely option because military action could not

"permanently remove the Chinese military threat." Less unlikely was a "punitive"

strike along the border by the Soviets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During late July and early August 1969, President Nixon made

his first trip to Asia, with a trip to Romania on his way home, during

which he intensified his efforts to communicate to Beijing his interest

in a new relationship.&nbsp; Most significantly, during a meeting with

Pakistan's prime minister Yahya Khan, Nixon asked Khan to send a friendly

message to China on his behalf.<sup><a href="#5">5</a> </sup>National security

assistant Henry Kissinger accompanied Nixon and selectively briefed State

Department officials about some of the talks with Pakistani officials.

This cable, originally sent from Pakistan to the State Department, recounts

Kissinger's talk with Air Marshall Nur Khan. Khan had recently met with

Chinese Premier Zhou En-lai and passed on to Kissinger what he learned

of Zhou's apprehensions about Soviet intentions.&nbsp; Reportedly, Zhou

was ready to make some concessions to the Soviets about border claims<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>,

but he worried about the possibility of a Soviet "preemptive attack." If

Moscow struck, Zhou claimed, Beijing was ready to "respond in a war that

would `know no boundaries.'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>A few days after one of the most violent border incidents on

13 August (see <a href="#doc11">document 11</a>, below), Allen S. Whiting

met with Henry Kissinger at the Western White House and briefed him on

Chinese policy and the dangers of Sino-Soviet conflict. Whiting, a leading

China scholar, had worked successively at INR and the U.S. Consulate in

Hong Kong during the 1960s and then joined the University of Michigan's

faculty. He also worked as a consultant for the RAND Corporation in Santa

Monica, CA, where he was based during the summer of 1969. Using highly

classified intelligence information that he had collected during consultations

in Washington earlier in August, Whiting used the briefing to convey his

foreboding that massive Soviet deployments on the Sino-Soviet border spelled

early offensive action against the PRC, such as an attack against nuclear

facilities, possible escalation of the conflict, and even nuclear weapons

use. Besides suggesting steps to deter wider conflict and to reassure the

Chinese that Washington was not colluding with Moscow, Whiting argued that

the Sino-Soviet crisis provided an opening for a U.S. approach to Beijing:

China needed a relationship with Washington to balance off the Soviets.

Apparently unaware of the intelligence information on Soviet military activity

near the Chinese border, Kissinger asked for a written report that he could

show to Nixon; Whiting produced it after staying up all night. Whiting's

briefing significantly influenced Kissinger's thinking about rapprochement

with China.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#7">7</a></font></sup> It also inspired

highly secret National Security Council planning on possible U.S. steps

in the event of Sino-Soviet war.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#8">8</a></font></sup></blockquote>

<blockquote>A few days after the Kissinger-Whiting meeting, the Soviets

directly probed for U.S. reactions to a strike on Chinese nuclear facilities.

During the early 1960s, the United States had probed Soviet interest in

possible joint action against China's incipient nuclear capabilities but

Moscow would go no further in pressuring China than signing the Limited

Test Ban Treaty of 1963.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#9">9</a></font></sup>

Six years later, the tables turned. Boris Davydov, a KGB officer with diplomatic

cover, surprised INR Vietnam expert William Stearman by asking how the

United States would react if the Soviets solved one nuclear proliferation

problem: by attacking Chinese nuclear weapons facilities. The fact that

this extraordinary meeting took place has been disclosed before, but Stearman's

"memcon" has never been published.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#10">10</a></font></sup>

Soviet archives and perhaps the memories of former Soviet officials may

someday disclose whether Davydov's approach was part of a campaign to intimidate

the Chinese or an effort to test U.S. reactions to real contingency plans

(or both).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Davydov's query caused some consternation at the State Department

and a few days later a cable went out (drafted by Stearman) asking a number

of U.S. embassies to keep their ears open for similar queries from Soviet

officials. Stearman prefaced his message with an excerpt from National

Intelligence Estimate on Sino-Soviet relations; intelligence community

analysts opined that there "is at least some chance" that Moscow "may be

preparing to take action" to prevent Chinese nuclear forces from threatening

the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the analysts suggested that the likelihood

was not high that such a scenario could unfold because the Soviets, like

the Chinese, wanted to avoid a "full-scale war."</blockquote>

characterized as "1st rate," Hyland acknowledged that a limited Sino-Soviet

Union were less sanguine than Hyland about the benefits of a Sino-Soviet

argued that a Soviet attack could inflame Chinese nationalism and strengthen

Mao's standing; moreover, a "non-nuclear Soviet strike would have a vast

destabilizing effect" in Asia and Europe. Like Whiting, the consultants

worried that Beijing might believe that the United States was tacitly colluding

with the Soviet Union against China, the consultants recommended that Washington

"avoid any whiff of collusion" with Moscow, a point that Under Secretary

military officers that Washington would collude with Moscow against Beijing

is apparent in this summary of a conversation with Major General Sergei

Krakhmalov, the Soviet military attache in Tehran. Showing no compunction

about nuclear weapons use, the general argued that Moscow "would not hesitate

to use nuclear weapons against the Chinese if they attacked with major

analysts did not rule out the possibility that Moscow would take punishing

military actions to teach Beijing an "exemplary lesson."</blockquote>

but that problem coincided with worries about lack of control over labor

and students as well as unrest and criminal activity throughout the country.

To accelerate preparations for border war and to facilitate stricter internal

controls, Mao signed off on a Central Committee directive on 28 August.

The directive was widely distributed and U.S. authorities soon got wind

with China through secret channels; no doubt this raised Nixon's interest

in French Foreign Minister Maurice Schumann's thinking about Sino-Soviet

tensions. Schumann discounted the possibility of a Soviet preemptive strike

because of the danger of "major conflict." Instead, he believed that Moscow

was making threats to "scare China stiff" and thereby get Beijing to enter

into negotiations. Certainly, the meeting between Zhou and Soviet Prime

Minister Kosygin at Beijing airport a week later suggested that both sides

were seeking to avoid a crisis.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#16">16</a></font></sup></blockquote>

<blockquote>In his talk with Nixon, Schumann observed that Soviet communications

with the pro-Chinese Australian Communist Party indicated how far the Kremlin

was willing to go to let Beijing know that it "meant business." Apparently,

the Soviet message was ominous enough to prompt the Australians to send

a letter to other Communist parties warning them of the danger of Chinese-Russian

warfare. As INR experts noted, the border fighting raised serious dilemmas

for the world communist movement; both Russia and China were acting like

"traditional great powers" with their claims to be "the sole interpreter

and custodian of Marxism" becoming more and more disreputable. Indeed,

both Beijing and Moscow "may become the chief ideological target for a

growing number of communist parties."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although the Kosygin-Zhou meeting suggested that the crisis

was passing, apparently Kissinger did not see it that way. In this belated

memo to Nixon on the Davydov probe, Kissinger showed that he was especially

apprehensive about Chinese perceptions of U.S.-Soviet collusion: that the

Soviets were "using us to generate an impression ... that we are being

consulted in secret." With that in mind, he asked Nixon to approve a request

to the State Department to prepare guidance to the field "deploring reports

of a Soviet plan to make a pre-emptive military strike against Communist

China." Nixon's initials may be seen on Kissinger's request but whether

it went forward to the State Department is unclear: the guidance may have

become unnecessary because Sino-Soviet talks would soon be under way and

the chances of a confrontation had lessened considerably.</blockquote>

As this memorandum by Marshall Green indicates, State Department officials

were looking for any and all signs that Beijing was taking a new tack in

its approach to Washington. Thus, Green found it especially important that

Zhou En-lai would tell the French Ambassador that he had noticed that Washington

had not tried to "worsen" Sino-Soviet tensions and would not find a Sino-Soviet

war to its advantage. In this context, Green proposed new initiatives,

such as withdrawing U.S. destroyers from the Taiwan Strait, trade and travel

measures, etc., which Nixon and Kissinger followed up as signals to elicit

a friendly Chinese response.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Within a few weeks after the Kosygin-Zhou meeting, the two

sides agreed to border negotiations at an ambassadorial level. In agreeing

to the talks, Beijing backed away from its demand that Moscow recognize

the old border agreements as "unequal treaties." As the authors of this

CIA report argued, this concession suggested that Beijing had "flinched"

under the pressure of Soviet military threats. The analysts did not expect

the talks to produce a settlement but they believed that both sides had

found it imperative to negotiate, even if only "agreeing to disagree,"

in order to head off a serious crisis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the fall of 1969, while Beijing and Moscow were starting

to negotiate, the Chinese and the Americans were starting to communicate,

in a highly secret fashion, their interest in a dialogue. Nixon and Kissinger

approved the State Department's proposal to withdraw the destroyer patrol

from the Taiwan Strait; on 10 October Kissinger aired the decision with

the Chinese via the Pakistani government. The message took some time to

reach the Chinese leadership but on 19 December Kissinger learned from

Pakistani ambassador Hilaly that a recent Chinese gesture--the release

of two Americans whose yacht had strayed into PRC waters--was a direct

response to the White House overture. The friendly Chinese response to

U.S. proposals to revive the stalled ambassadorial talks in Warsaw was

another sign of a new tack in PRC diplomacy, although both Kissinger and

Chinese policymakers would abandon the Warsaw channel as a vehicle of communication.

Although it would take months before Henry Kissinger made his secret trip

to Beijing, the Pakistani channel played a central role in expediting that

development.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#19">19</a></font></sup></blockquote>

<blockquote>The CIA's China watchers did not know of the Pakistani channel

so they could not take into account all of the "signs of life" in Chinese

diplomacy. Nevertheless, they were right to suggest that a "new ... period"

was underway and that anxiety about a "Soviet threat" had prompted the

"diplomatic offensive." Interestingly, the analysts reported that Zhou

Enlai had signed a secret directive ordering a "limited flexible approach"

toward Washington in order to put Moscow off balance. If the report on

Zhou's directive was accurate, perhaps this document will someday surface
